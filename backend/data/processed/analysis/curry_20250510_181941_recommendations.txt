DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------
1. Lower Body Mechanics:
   • Maintain consistent depth in your shot preparation
   • Practice shooting from different spots to improve spatial awareness
   • Maintain consistent depth in your shot preparation
   • Practice shooting from different spots to improve spatial awareness

2. Shot Release and Follow-through:
   • Ensure your shooting hand follows through straight toward the basket
   • Practice one-handed form shots from close range to perfect the release
   • Keep your elbow closer to your body (currently too high)
   • Focus on a stronger wrist flick at release
   • Ensure your shooting hand follows through straight toward the basket
   • Practice one-handed form shots from close range to perfect the release

3. Body Positioning:

PRACTICE DRILLS:
--------------------
1. Form Shooting Drill:
   • Start 2-3 feet from the basket
   • Focus on perfect form with deep knee bend
   • Shoot 50 shots with emphasis on proper mechanics
   • Gradually move back as form improves

2. Elbow Control Drill:
   • Stand in front of a mirror
   • Practice bringing the ball up with elbow tucked in
   • Focus on keeping elbow at 90 degrees
   • Repeat 20 times before shooting

3. Depth Control Drill:
   • Place markers at different distances
   • Practice shooting from each marker
   • Focus on maintaining consistent form
   • Track your success rate at each distance

PROGRESS TRACKING:
--------------------
• Record your shooting percentage from each distance
• Note improvements in knee bend and elbow position
• Track consistency of release point
• Monitor overall shooting percentage

Remember: Focus on one aspect at a time. Master the fundamentals before moving to more advanced techniques.
