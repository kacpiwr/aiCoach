DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------
1. Lower Body Mechanics:
   • Bend your knees more deeply during the shot preparation
   • Aim for a 90-degree knee bend at the lowest point
   • Keep your feet shoulder-width apart for better stability

2. Shot Release and Follow-through:

3. Body Positioning:
   • Stand slightly closer to the basket (current horizontal distance is too far)
   • Keep your body aligned with the basket

PRACTICE DRILLS:
--------------------
1. Form Shooting Drill:
   • Start 2-3 feet from the basket
   • Focus on perfect form with deep knee bend
   • Shoot 50 shots with emphasis on proper mechanics
   • Gradually move back as form improves

2. Elbow Control Drill:
   • Stand in front of a mirror
   • Practice bringing the ball up with elbow tucked in
   • Focus on keeping elbow at 90 degrees
   • Repeat 20 times before shooting

3. Depth Control Drill:
   • Place markers at different distances
   • Practice shooting from each marker
   • Focus on maintaining consistent form
   • Track your success rate at each distance

PROGRESS TRACKING:
--------------------
• Record your shooting percentage from each distance
• Note improvements in knee bend and elbow position
• Track consistency of release point
• Monitor overall shooting percentage

Remember: Focus on one aspect at a time. Master the fundamentals before moving to more advanced techniques.
